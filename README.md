# Image Gallery Project

This is a responsive and beautifully designed **Image Gallery** named **SHOTS** built using **HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript**. The design and layout were inspired by **Pixabay**, but the entire code and implementation have been created by me from scratch.

## Features
- Clean, elegant image layout
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Hover effects for interactivity
- Lightweight and fast

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – for the structure
- **CSS** – for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – like click/hover effects

## Project Status
This is a personal frontend project and part of my ongoing practice in web design and development.
